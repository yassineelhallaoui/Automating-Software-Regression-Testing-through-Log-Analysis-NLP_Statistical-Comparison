Automating Software Regression Testing through Log Analysis A Statistical Comparison Approach using NLP Techniques
### <span style="color:yellow">**Background & Context:**<span style="color:lime">

The research presents important findings for the field of software regression testing. It introduces a new method that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and statistical techniques to automate the testing process.

What's great about this method is that it can quickly find errors, make tests more accurate, and better use resources. Understanding log data from regression testing can be quite tricky. However, by using NLP, this research tackles that problem. It's like using a new lens to view and analyze the data more clearly. On top of that, the research uses statistical tests, like the t-test, f-test, and ANOVA.

These tests make the results more trustworthy and even provide visual ways to see the outcomes. Why is this research so impactful? Because it can change how we approach software regression testing. It promises to make the testing process faster, more effective, and helps testers make better decisions. This study is timely and useful because the software industry is looking for 10ways to automate regression testing. Plus, it adds value to the methods used to ensure software
is of high quality.
